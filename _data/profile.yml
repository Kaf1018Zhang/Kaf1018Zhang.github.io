  <p>
    Hi! I am Kaijie Zhang (He/Him). I come from Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. I am a third-year undergraduate student at UC San Diego, majoring in Data Science with a minor in Mathematics. 
    I completed my first two years of study at UC Irvine, where I pursued a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.
      My academic interests span software development, machine learning algorithms, data analysis, medical data science, and large language models (LLMs).
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of academics, I enjoy staying attuned to intriguing and meaningful events happening around the world. 
    Each summer, I team up with friends to compete in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_hunt" target="_blank">puzzle hunts</a>, especially those hosted by CCBC and Puzzle and Key Universe. 
    I'm often inspired by the clever design behind these challenges. I'm also always up for a good conversation about ACG (anime, comics, and games) with friends.
  </p>
