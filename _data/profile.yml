  <p>
    Hi! I am Kaijie Zhang (He/Him). I come from Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. I am a third-year undergraduate student at UC San Diego, majoring in Data Science with a minor in Mathematics. 
    I completed my first two years of study at UC Irvine, where I pursued a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.
      My academic interests include software development, algorithms in machine learning and deep learning, data analysis, medical applications of data science, and large language models (LLMs).
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of academics, I enjoy staying attuned to intriguing and meaningful events happening around the world. 
    Each summer, I team up with friends to compete in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_hunt" target="_blank">puzzle hunts</a>, especially those hosted by CCBC and Puzzle and Key Universe. 
    I'm often inspired by the clever design behind these challenges. I'm also always up for a good conversation about ACG (anime, comics, and games) with friends.
  </p>
